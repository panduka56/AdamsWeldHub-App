Gas Flow Cheat Sheet - Quick Reference Guide
Maintaining the correct gas flow rate is essential for producing high-quality welds. Use this cheat sheet as a quick reference for optimal settings.

MIG Welding (GMAW)
Mild Steel: 20–25 CFH (Cubic Feet per Hour)
Stainless Steel: 25–30 CFH
Aluminum: 25–30 CFH
TIG Welding (GTAW)
Mild Steel and Stainless Steel: 15–20 CFH
Aluminum: 15–25 CFH
Flux-Cored Welding (FCAW)
Self-Shielded Flux-Cored: No shielding gas required
Gas-Shielded Flux-Cored: 30–40 CFH
Tips:

Indoor Welding: Standard flow rates as above are suitable.
Outdoor Welding: Increase flow rates by 25%–50% to compensate for wind.
Avoid Turbulence: Excessive gas flow can cause turbulence, introducing air into the weld pool.
MIG Welding Issues
Porosity in Welds
Description:

Porosity refers to gas pockets or voids that form within the weld metal, compromising the strength and integrity of the weld. It appears as small holes on the surface or within the weld bead.

Common Causes:

Contaminated Base Metal: Presence of oil, grease, rust, or paint.
Improper Shielding Gas Flow: Low flow rates or leaks causing insufficient gas coverage.
Drafty Environment: Wind or drafts blowing away shielding gas.
Moisture: Humidity or moisture in the electrode or base metal.
Incorrect Welding Parameters: Excessive voltage or travel speed.
Recommended Fixes:

Clean the Welding Surface:

Remove contaminants using a degreaser, wire brush, or grinder.
Ensure the metal is dry before welding.
Check Shielding Gas System:

Inspect hoses, connections, and the regulator for leaks.
Set the gas flow rate to the recommended level (typically 20–25 CFH for mild steel).
Control the Environment:

Shield the welding area from drafts using screens or curtains.
Avoid welding outdoors in windy conditions if possible.
Use Dry Consumables:

Store electrodes and filler wires in a dry location.
Replace any consumables exposed to moisture.
Adjust Welding Technique:

Reduce travel speed to ensure proper gas coverage.
Maintain the correct stick-out length (the distance from the contact tip to the workpiece).
Use appropriate voltage and amperage settings as per manufacturer recommendations.
Regular Maintenance:

Clean or replace worn contact tips and nozzles.
Ensure the gas diffuser is functioning correctly.
Preventive Measures:

Routine Equipment Checks: Regularly inspect and maintain welding equipment.
Training: Ensure welders are trained on proper techniques and equipment usage.
Environmental Control: Implement measures to control environmental factors affecting welding quality.
TIG Welding Issues
Arc Starting Problems
Description:

Difficulty initiating or maintaining a stable arc during TIG welding can lead to poor weld quality and frustration.

Common Causes:

Contaminated Tungsten Electrode: Presence of oxides or inclusions.
Incorrect Electrode Type: Using the wrong tungsten type for the material or current.
Improper Machine Settings: Incorrect amperage or polarity.
Poor Ground Connection: Inadequate work clamp contact.
Recommended Fixes:

Prepare the Tungsten Electrode:

Grind the electrode to a fine point for DC welding or a balled end for AC welding.
Use a dedicated grinding wheel to prevent contamination.
Select the Right Electrode:

Choose the appropriate tungsten type (e.g., 2% Thoriated for DC, Pure Tungsten for AC).
Adjust Machine Settings:

Set the correct amperage based on material thickness.
Ensure the polarity matches the welding process (DCEN for most TIG welding).
Improve Ground Connection:

Attach the work clamp directly to clean metal.
Ensure the clamp and cable are in good condition.
Use High-Frequency Start:

Enable high-frequency start if available to aid in arc initiation.
Preventive Measures:

Equipment Maintenance: Regularly check and replace worn components.
Clean Work Area: Remove any contaminants from the welding area.
General Welding Issues
Cracks in Welds
Description:

Cracks can occur in or near the weld, leading to structural failures. They may be visible immediately or develop over time.

Common Causes:

High Carbon Content: Materials with high carbon are prone to cracking.
Rapid Cooling: Excessive cooling rates cause thermal stresses.
Hydrogen Embrittlement: Hydrogen trapped in the weld metal.
Improper Welding Technique: Excessive heat input or incorrect welding parameters.
Recommended Fixes:

Preheat the Material:

Preheating reduces thermal gradients and minimizes stress.
Control Cooling Rates:

Use post-weld heat treatments to relieve stresses.
Cover the weld area to slow down cooling.
Use Low-Hydrogen Electrodes:

Select appropriate consumables to reduce hydrogen content.
Modify Welding Technique:

Adjust amperage and travel speed to control heat input.
Employ proper joint design to distribute stresses.
Material Selection:

Use materials with lower carbon content or alloying elements that reduce cracking susceptibility.
Preventive Measures:

Material Testing: Analyze materials for weldability before starting.
Procedure Qualification: Develop and follow qualified welding procedures.
